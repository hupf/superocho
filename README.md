An 8-Step analog sequencer with CV and Gate outputs.

The sequencer circuit is inspired by [captain's analog Baby 10 sequencer](http://static.flickr.com/107/309524222_7dee86bda1_b.jpg) that uses a 4017 decade counter IC. For the clock it uses a [timer circuit described on elektronik-kompendium.de](http://www.elektronik-kompendium.de/sites/praxis/bausatz_taktgenerator-mit-lmc555cn.htm), based on a NE555 timer IC.

The panel design graphic is also included in the repository. It fits on a Hammond Electronics 1590R1 case.

The following circuit is designed to be soldered onto a Euro strip board. There are very good instructions by Bernhard Redemann on how to do this (in German): [Professionelles Löten von Lochrasterplatinen](http://www.b-redemann.de/download/loeten.pdf)
